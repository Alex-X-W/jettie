Our project is basically two folds, with one fold more of nlp flavor and the other more system/engineering oriented.


1. syntactic parser with two methods

i) shift-reduce
ii) linearize syntactic tree and do it like a machine translation using seq2seq model


2. build a minimal lightweight JET like system in Python

motivation:
a) Tipster architecture good for 1)pipelining; 2)systematic experiment on IE tasks and 3) alignment of annotations which might facilitates future visualization work
b) can be used later in our own work, and in Python which we are more familiar with

we will only do a minimal version in the sense that it implements the Tipster, and can be used to do the preceding syntactic parser task
